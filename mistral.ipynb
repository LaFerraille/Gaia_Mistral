      "3. Brie de Meaux: A soft, creamy cow's milk cheese with a white rind, originating from the Marne region, known for its mild, buttery, and slightly sweet flavor.\n",
      "4. Comté: A hard, nutty, and slightly sweet cow's milk cheese from the Franche-Comté region, with a complex, rich, and savory taste.\n",
      "5. Munster: A soft, pungent, smelly cow's milk cheese from Alsace, known for its strong, distinctive aroma and flavor, with hints of garlic and onion.\n",
      "6. Époisses: A soft, pungent, and runny cow's milk cheese from Burgundy, famous for its strong, ammonia-like smell and rich, buttery taste.\n",
      "7. Chaource: A soft, white, surface-ripened cow's milk cheese from the Île-de-France region, with a mild, buttery, and slightly tangy flavor.\n",
      "\n",
