# GAIA Hackathon

Welcome to the GAIA Hackathon! This hackathon is a collaborative effort between Comexposium, La Ferme Digitale, and Mistral AI, aimed at developing innovative solutions to address key challenges in the agriculture sector.

## Hackathon Description

Participants in this hackathon will be tasked with designing tools capable of answering questions posed through one-minute videos. To accomplish this, teams will have access to a kit containing 50 solutions and 150 datasets provided by the hackathon organizers, starting from January 29, 2024. This approach will enable the rapid development of concrete and operational proof-of-concepts (POCs).

As part of this hackathon, Comexposium and La Ferme Digitale have partnered with Mistral AI to provide participants with privileged access to the first multimodal agricultural AI model. This model combines natural language, voice, images, and data to create a comprehensive and innovative solution. The POCs developed during the hackathon will contribute to the utilization and enhancement of this model, opening up new possibilities for the application of AI in the agricultural domain. Two demonstrations have been set up, which participants can access (level 1 and level 2).

For getting started, we highly recommend using [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).

If you have any technical questions, please visit the Mistral support site on [Discord](https://discord.gg/pCePuRhG).

If you wish to conduct local tests and do not have a MISTRAL API key, please contact us directly via email.

The elements will continue to evolve for 15 days, but all the main concepts are already present. Participants in the GAIA hackathon will be confronted with crucial questions, including farm succession, the attractiveness of agricultural professions and training, crop management, livestock management, purchasing and selling, as well as deciphering standards and regulations.

The goal is to find innovative, practical, and pragmatic solutions that can be implemented immediately to address these essential challenges for the future of agriculture.
